They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.

Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.

They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the host of the gathering where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was introduced to George Sand?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5a", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5d", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5e", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8b", "answers": [{"text": "George Sand", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8e", "answers": [{"text": "his poor health", "answer_start": 503}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8f", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146288", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146289", "answers": [{"text": "1837", "answer_start": 327}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628b", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628c", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001.

Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created.

The C-X75 was originally developed as a hybrid electric vehicle with four independent electric engines powered by two jet turbines, before the project was cancelled. The version used for filming was converted to use a conventional internal combustion engine, to minimise the potential for disruption from mechanical problems with the complex hybrid system. The C-X75s used for filming were developed by the engineering division of Formula One racing team Williams, who built the original C-X75 prototype for Jaguar."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where did Spectre filming take place after Rome?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c0", "answers": [{"text": "Mexico City", "answer_start": 52}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which celebration was featured in the Mexico City part of the production?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c1", "answers": [{"text": "Day of the Dead", "answer_start": 143}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which areas were shown in the Day of the Dead scene in Spectre?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c2", "answers": [{"text": "the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many additional actors were needed for the shoot in Mexico City?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c3", "answers": [{"text": "1,500", "answer_start": 544}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where were the scenes featuring planes shot?", "id": "56cdf49362d2951400fa69c4", "answers": [{"text": "Palenque", "answer_start": 681}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What festival was included in the scenes shot in Mexico?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4c", "answers": [{"text": "the Day of the Dead festival", "answer_start": 139}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of helicopter was used for the flight scenes?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f4f", "answers": [{"text": "a Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter", "answer_start": 340}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where in Mexico were the Day of the Dead scenes shot?", "id": "56cf49ebaab44d1400b88f50", "answers": [{"text": "Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "Filming moved to which city in late May?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Mexico", "answer_start": 52}], "question": "In which city was the film's closing sequence filmed?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286c9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city square", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "What was closed in order to film a fight sequence using a boat?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "city", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "The scene in which square required about 2,500 extras?", "id": "5ad2306ed7d075001a4286cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "With filming completed in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March to shoot the film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed in and around the Z\u00f3calo and the Centro Hist\u00f3rico district.

In a lukewarm review for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as inconsistent and unable to capitalise on its potential. Kenneth Turan, reviewing the film for Los Angeles Times, concluded that Spectre \"comes off as exhausted and uninspired\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times panned the film as having \"nothing surprising\" and sacrificing its originality for the sake of box office returns. Forbes' Scott Mendelson also heavily criticised the film, denouncing Spectre as \"the worst 007 movie in 30 years\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly viewed Spectre as \"an overreaction to our current blockbuster moment\", aspiring \"to be a serialized sequel\" and proving \"itself as a Saga\". While noting that \"[n]othing that happens in Spectre holds up to even minor logical scrutiny\", he had \"come not to bury Spectre, but to weirdly praise it. Because the final act of the movie is so strange, so willfully obtuse, that it deserves extra attention.\" In a positive review Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing \"The 24th movie about the British MI6 agent with a license to kill is party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies\".

After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937.

To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society.

Lee used the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism. However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent.

Drawing inspiration from artists such as Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George, and maintaining a \"minimal but functional\" approach towards the album's studio production, West explored the electronic feel produced by Auto-Tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808, manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synthesizers, and somber piano, and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups, with West himself later confessing an affinity with British post-punk group Joy Division. Rolling Stone journalist Matthew Trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article, \"Now that popular music has finally caught up to it, 808s & Heartbreak has revealed itself to be Kanye\u2019s most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant.\""}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is Kanye's fifth album titled?

For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of \u0101tman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and thus without any underlying essence; they are \"empty\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the M\u0101dhyamaka. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon.

A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading \"Paris defends human rights throughout the world\" to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values \"of all humanity and of human rights.\" Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: \"I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying.

The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to \"thwart any organized protest that had been planned.\" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a \"cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money.\" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in \"everyone's best interest\" and that he believed people had been \"afforded the right to protest and support the torch\" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, \"The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded.\" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD $726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising.

A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like institute of technology, polytechnic university, university of applied sciences, or university of technology for marketing purposes. Such emergence of so many upgraded polytechnics, former vocational education and technical schools converted into more university-like institutions has caused concern where the lack of specialized intermediate technical professionals lead to industrial skill shortages in some fields, being also associated to an increase of the graduate unemployment rate. This is mostly the case in those countries, where the education system is not controlled by the state and everybody can grant degrees.[citation needed] Evidence have also shown a decline in the general quality of teaching and graduate's preparation for the workplace, due to the fast-paced conversion of that technical institutions to more advanced higher level institutions.

Oct. 15, 2004), a litigant attempted to use the Wayback Machine archives as a source of admissible evidence, perhaps for the first time. Telewizja Polska is the provider of TVP Polonia and EchoStar operates the Dish Network. Prior to the trial proceedings, EchoStar indicated that it intended to offer Wayback Machine snapshots as proof of the past content of Telewizja Polska's web site. Telewizja Polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source, but Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys rejected Telewizja Polska's assertion of hearsay and denied TVP's motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial. At the trial, however, district Court Judge Ronald Guzman, the trial judge, overruled Magistrate Keys' findings,[citation needed] and held that neither the affidavit of the Internet Archive employee nor the underlying pages (i.e., the Telewizja Polska website) were admissible as evidence. Judge Guzman reasoned that the employee's affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements, and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticating.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "When are Internet Archive timestamps useful for patent offices?", "id": "56ddca9d9a695914005b95d7", "answers": [{"text": "in examining a patent application", "answer_start": 375}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a condition that must be met for the Internet Archive data to be considered acceptable for submission to patent offices in the US and Europe?", "id": "56ddca9d9a695914005b95d8", "answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "in examining a patent application", "answer_start": 375}], "question": "When are Internet Archive timestamps harmful for patent offices?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9ed8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "question": "What is an example of a condition that must be met for the Internet Archive data to be considered acceptable for submission to patent offices on the Web?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9ed9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "dates", "answer_start": 294}], "question": "What are used to determine if a patent is available?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9eda", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "United States patent office and the European Patent Office", "answer_start": 112}], "question": "What will accept date stamps from the public?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9edb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "authoritative statement of the archivist", "answer_start": 65}], "question": "What does the patent offices require before they accept applications for employment?", "id": "5a6b1877a9e0c9001a4e9edc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Provided some additional requirements are met (e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist), the United States patent office and the European Patent Office will accept date stamps from the Internet Archive as evidence of when a given Web page was accessible to the public.

This is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism, and DNA repair and recombination. While important genes participating in the DNA to RNA transcription, protein translation and DNA/RNA replication are retained. That is, a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter-genic regions or open reading frame (ORF) size. Thus, species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them, thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates. As the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission, intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process, resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria. This incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as Muller's ratchet phenomenon. Muller's ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non-essential genes of the intracellular bacteria. This could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What language do the roots of \"commensal\" come from?", "id": "56de2bedcffd8e1900b4b60c", "answers": [{"text": "Latin", "answer_start": 254}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of symbiotic relationship helps one organism and doesn't have a major affect on the other?", "id": "56de2bedcffd8e1900b4b60d", "answers": [{"text": "Commensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What type of symbiotic relationship happens when there is a major affect on the other organism?", "id": "5a8008cf8f0597001ac0014f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "sharing a table", "answer_start": 303}], "question": "What takes place when the organisms are neither significantly harmed or helped?", "id": "5a8008cf8f0597001ac00150", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 46}], "question": "Commensalism explains a relationship between how many organisms when one gains most of the benefits?", "id": "5a8008cf8f0597001ac00151", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What word is derived from the medieval English word?", "id": "5a8008cf8f0597001ac00152", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "two living organisms", "answer_start": 46}], "question": "Who is actually sharing a table?", "id": "5a8008cf8f0597001ac00153", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.

Competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What organisms is the ibex in an amensalistic relationship with?", "id": "56de42a94396321400ee2730", "answers": [{"text": "weevils", "answer_start": 472}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the Spanish ibex eat?", "id": "56de42a94396321400ee2731", "answers": [{"text": "shrub", "answer_start": 535}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of relationship is it when large animals crush small plants?", "id": "56de42a94396321400ee2732", "answers": [{"text": "Amensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What happens if a weevil eats from an ibex?", "id": "5a8012f38f0597001ac00177", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amensalism", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What happens when the grass causes damage to an animal's hoof?", "id": "5a8012f38f0597001ac00178", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 455}], "question": "What ethnicity are the ibex and the weevils?", "id": "5a8012f38f0597001ac00179", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "food availability", "answer_start": 603}], "question": "What is altered if the presence of ibex has little detrimental effect on the number of weevil?", "id": "5a8012f38f0597001ac0017a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Timarcha", "answer_start": 493}], "question": "What genus are the Spanish ibex?", "id": "5a8012f38f0597001ac0017b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other.

Air Force personnel, particularly officers, prefer the wedge cap to any other form of headdress. There is no naval variant of the wedge cap. The Yukon cap and tuque are worn only with winter dress, although clearance and combat divers may wear tuques year-round as a watch cap.

Certain is only that Avestan (all forms) and Old Persian are distinct, and since Old Persian is \"western\", and Avestan was not Old Persian, Avestan acquired a default assignment to \"eastern\". Confusing the issue is the introduction of a western Iranian substrate in later Avestan compositions and redactions undertaken at the centers of imperial power in western Iran (either in the south-west in Persia, or in the north-west in Nisa/Parthia and Ecbatana/Media)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What elements of Proto-Indo-Iranian did not diverge according to the ensuing split between eastern and western variants?", "id": "56ddfdc4cffd8e1900b4b556", "answers": [{"text": "*\u0107 and *d\u017a", "answer_start": 216}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of letters are *\u0107 and *d\u017a?", "id": "56ddfdc4cffd8e1900b4b557", "answers": [{"text": "first-series palatal consonants", "answer_start": 183}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Two of the earliest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What Iranian dialects did not follow the Western and Eastern blocks?", "id": "5a18e2b99aa02b0018605f02", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "palatal", "answer_start": 196}], "question": "What type of valves are c and dz?", "id": "5a18e2b99aa02b0018605f03", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Two of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks.

The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary. The King's Ministers were in most cases members of one of the two Houses of Parliament, and the Government needed to sustain the support of a majority in the House of Commons. One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords. Therefore, it may be seen that the three branches of British government often violated the strict principle of separation of powers, even though there were many occasions when the different branches of the government disagreed with each other. Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the Governor also functioned as a member of the state's highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The President of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as Vice Presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers.

Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index.
