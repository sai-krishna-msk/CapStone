Software maintenance is a part of the Software Development Life Cycle. Its primary goal is to modify and update software application after delivery to correct errors and to improve performance. Software is a model of the real world. When the real world changes, the software require alteration wherever possible.
Software Maintenance is an inclusive activity that includes error corrections, enhancement of capabilities, deletion of obsolete capabilities, and optimization
Software Maintenance is needed for:-

- Correct errors
- Change in user requirement with time
- Changing hardware/software requirements
- To improve system efficiency

Following are the types of maintenance
Corrective maintenance aims to correct any remaining errors regardless of where they may cause specifications, design, coding, testing, and documentation, etc.
Adaptive Maintenance is used for modifying the software to match changes in the ever-changing environment.
Perfective Maintenance, It defines improving processing efficiency or performance or restricting the software to enhance changeability. This may contain enhancement of existing system functionality, improvement in computational efficiency, etc.
