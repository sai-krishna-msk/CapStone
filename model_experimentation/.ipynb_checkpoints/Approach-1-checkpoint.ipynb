    "OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Java’s Object Oriented Programming. They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Grasping them is key to understanding how Java works. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main OOP concepts in Java. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction. Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don’t need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraction means simple things like objects, classes, and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is important because it lets avoid repeating the same work multiple times.\n",
    "Encapsulation. This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It’s a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use objects like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system-wide.\n",
    "Inheritance. This is a special feature of Object Oriented Programming in Java. It lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. This lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "Polymorphism. This Java OOP concept lets programmers use the same word to mean different things in different contexts. One form of polymorphism in Java is method overloading. That’s when different meanings are implied by the code itself. The other form is method overriding. That’s when the different meanings are implied by the values of the supplied variables. See more on this below.\n",

    "Process Synchronization is a way to coordinate processes that use shared data. It occurs in an operating system among cooperating processes. Cooperating processes are processes that share resources. While executing many concurrent processes, process synchronization helps to maintain shared data consistency and cooperating process execution. Processes have to be scheduled to ensure that concurrent access to shared data does not create inconsistencies. Data inconsistency can result in what is called a race condition. A race condition occurs when two or more operations are executed at the same time, not scheduled in the proper sequence, and not exited in the critical section correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical Section\n",
    "A critical section is a segment of code that can be accessed by only one signal process at a certain instance in time. This section consists of shared data resources that need to be accessed by other processes. The entry to the critical section is handled by the wait() function, represented as P(). The exit from a critical section is controlled by the signal() function, represented as V(). Only one process can be executed inside the critical section at a time. Other processes waiting to execute their critical sections have to wait until the current process finishes executing its critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semaphores\n",
    "A critical section execution is handled by a semaphore. A semaphore is simply a variable that stores an integer value. This integer can be accessed by two operations: wait() and signal(). When a process enters the critical section, P(s) is invoked and the semaphore s is set to 1. After the process exits the critical section, s is re-initialized to 0. An example of how Process P is executed inside the critical section is shown below:\n",
